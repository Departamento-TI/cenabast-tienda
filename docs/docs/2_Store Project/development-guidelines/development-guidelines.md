# Overview

:::danger[Commits Flow]
All contributions must follow a trunk based development approach:
So, new features must born from the `main` branch.\

If its based on a JIRA issue, use the JIRA prefix of the feature for naming the branch:

```
<JIRA issue number(s)>-<lowercase-description-of-branch>
```

Some examples:
```
PE188-1-initalize-project

PE188-4-5-6-add-base-instalation-configuration
```

More information about this can be found in the project README.
