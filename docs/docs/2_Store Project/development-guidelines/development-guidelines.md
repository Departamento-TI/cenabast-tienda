# Resumen

:::danger[CommitsFlow]
You must follow the [Gitflow standard](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).\
So, all new features must born from the `develop` branch.\
Once a feature is finished, a Pull Request **should be added** to the `develop` branch. The PR should be assigned to the proper technical leader.
