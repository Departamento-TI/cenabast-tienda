# Applications

We need to deploy the following applications in the DEV server:

- PostgreSQL
- Keycloak
- Spree Commerce

:::info
All applications must be deployed using Docker container.
Ideally, we need to build the image locally.
:::

:::tip[Database]
Both Keycloak and Spree Commerce should use the same database service.
